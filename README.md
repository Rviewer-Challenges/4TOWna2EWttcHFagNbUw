## Instructions

Are you able to build the best RSS reader?
Create a news aggregator focused on a single industry.

Let's start at the beginning, what is RSS?
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and it is used to distribute information associated with web content in XML
format.

Let's think about the world of software development; so much news appear every day that we don't know how to consume
such amount of information. Sometimes even where to start looking.

The goal of this Challenge is to create the best news aggregator app in RSS format.
